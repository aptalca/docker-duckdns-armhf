# linuxserver/duckdns

Duck DNS is a free service which will point a DNS (sub domains of duckdns.org) to an IP of your choice. The service is completely free, and doesn't require reactivation or forum posts to maintain its existence.

## Usage

```
docker create \
  --name=DuckDNS \
  -e PGID=<gid> -e PUID=<uid>  \
  -e SUBDOMAINS=<subdomains> \
  -e TOKEN=<token> \
  linuxserver/duckdns
```

## Parameters

`The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side. 
For example with a port -p external:internal - what this shows is the port mapping from internal to external of the container.
So -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080
http://192.168.x.x:8080 would show you what's running INSIDE the container on port 80.`


* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation
* `-e SUBDOMAINS` for subdomains - multiple subdomains allowed, comma separated, no spaces
* `-e TOKEN` for DuckDNS token


### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`. To find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Setting up the application

First, go to www.duckdns.org, register your subdomain and retrieve your token  
Then run the docker create command above with your subdomain(s) and token  
It will update your IP with the DuckDNS service every 5 minutes  


## Updates

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it DuckDNS /bin/bash`
* Upgrade to the latest version: `docker restart DuckDNS`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f DuckDNS`
